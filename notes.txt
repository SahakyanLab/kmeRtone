Observation/Note

Upstream or downstream of one gene can overlap with other gene

Here gene transcript is composed of upstream region, exon(s), intron(s), and downstream region.

Gene is defined as transcribed region of the genome. It can be coding and noncoding.

Intergenic region (IGR) is defined as region at 5000-7500 away from coding and noncoding gene transcripts (including upstream and downstream regions). If the region overlaps with other RefSeq record (coding and noncoding transcripts), the overlapped portion are removed. Minimum length is 150. This method reflects that IGR is not noncoding genes in the RefSeq database and it cannot be upstream and dowmstream region of any gene.

Situation 1 [Not implemented yet]
CMC4 vs. MTCP1 (NCBI says they are the same)
Record in RefSeq has different name, different transcript length, and different exon block arrangement.
How do I automatically differentiate this across the annotation table?
-- Check for overlapping region. Mark them as one transcript region.
Which one should I choose?
-- Longest transcript length (the caveat is the different exon arrangement e.g. intron of one arrangement can be exon in the other.)
